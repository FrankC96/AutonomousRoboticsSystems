# Repository for the Autonomous Robotics Systems course.
This project will use Pygame in order to demonstrate the practical usages of:
1) Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithms
2) Neural controllers for robot positioning and exploration
3) and lastly the use of an Extended Kalman Filter for robot localization.

The algorithms are based on the books "Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence
Theories, Methods, and Technologies" by Dario Floreano, Claudio Mattiussi and "Probabilistic Robotics" by Sebastian Thrun, Wolfram Burgard, Dieter Fox.
